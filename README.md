What this Website is about
==========================

Here I want to **explain** what this website is about. Well there's not much to say, cause I just made it to get some exercise in creating websites. When you remember the times you did this feel with me. _It's actually fun._ :-) Remember? At least if you have great tutorials as I have. I feel like I'm becoming a programmer within weeks.

In the end I will be able to use:

* git
* html
* css
* ruby

and the end goal is **RUBY ON RAILS**.
